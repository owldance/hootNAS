# hootNAS - webserver

## webserver.mjs

**On boot** the service `hootsrv.service` starts the webserver target 
[webserver.mjs](./webserver.mjs) which in turn starts the webapp 
target [index.html](/webapp/dist/index.html).

The directory structure of the [webserver folder](/webserver/) is as follows: 

    ðŸ“¦webserver
    â”£ ðŸ“‚routes
    â”£ ðŸ“‚controllers
    â”— ðŸ“‚services

Routes only authorize and chain together controller functions, no other logic 
should go here. Controllers handle the request and call the services, and 
decide what to do with the data returned from the services, and then send the 
response back to the client. Services call various webapi's and handle the 
data returned, no experess.js context should be in the services.
