# hootNAS - webapi

The webapi consists of js modules containing methods which can be called by the 
webserver. 


@todo in [initialSetup.mjs](blockdevices/initialSetup.mjs) btrfs raid for 
persistance partitions is broken since kernel 5.19.0-42 with btrfs-progs v5.16.2. 

on mount, the kernel will complain about missing devices, because the udev 
rules calls 'btrfs device scan' which scans for devices in /dev/disk/by-uuid 
which udev do not create consistently.

[This archlinux source](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Persistent_block_device_naming#by-uuid) 
claims that uuid identifiers are generated by filesystem utilities e.g. 
mkfs.btrfs, and not by udev.

see man pages for mkfs.btrfs, udev and btrfs-device
