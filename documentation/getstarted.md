# hootNAS - Getting started

## Status of the project

The hootNAS ISO image can presently boot up satisfactory and present an IP 
address on the terminal. The web application is not yet functional, and the API 
is not yet fully implemented.

You can build the ISO image yourself by following 
[this guide](../hoot-os/README.md), or download 
[latest ISO image releases](https://github.com/owldance/hootNAS/releases).

## Getting started

More to come soon...
